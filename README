                              libkino.com sources

this repository contains the libkino.com source code. i have written this site
in go with its stdlib's template engine with (very little) tailwind and htmx
mixed in.

could i have written this with normal, honest to god, church-attending
web2.0 html+css? absolutely. but the way it is now is future-proof if it
(doubtfully) ever blows up and we need to implement some more complex functions.
